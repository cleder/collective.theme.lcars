Introduction

Did you ever want to command a starship? Here is your oportunity, style
your plone website with an LCARS interface.

For the beginning of the new year I wanted to polish up my CSS and diazo
skills, the LCARS interface seemed to be a nice challenge.
The themes I found on the internet required either flash or JavaScript
and did not satisfy me so I implemented it from scatch using the
beyondskins.responsive design by Simples Consultoria
http://plone.org/products/beyondskins.responsive as a base.
I am aware that the theme as is is probably only of use in a star treck
fan site, but it demonstrates some css solutions that can be applied for
other designs too.
